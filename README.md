# Git-Backup
  :floppy_disk: A soon to be small tool for archiving GitHub repos.
# About
  I was originally making this to run on a pi 24/7 to make backups of my or anyone else's git repos. This is extremely incomplete and has bad code. Maybe someday I'll fix it so it will actualy work, and who knows, I might swap to python just to make it easier on myself.
