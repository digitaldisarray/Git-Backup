# Git-Backup
  :floppy_disk: A soon to be small tool for archiving GitHub repos.
# About
  I was originally making this to run on a pi 24/7 to make backups of my git repos. (or anyone else's)
  This is extremely incomplete and has bad code. Maybe someday I'll fix it so it will actualy work.
  Maybe I'll swap to python just to make it easier on myself.
